# Welcome to my R portfolio :)

## _**Name of file**_: _`Dawood_week6.Rmd`_

_**What it does**_: This file contains R code structured to create several publication-quality visualizations using the **`ggplot2`** and **`palmerpenguins`** packages. Specifically, it includes:

- A violin plot showing the relationship between penguin flipper length and sex.
- A faceted violin plot to display flipper length differences across species while distinguishing between sexes.
- A violin plot comparing flipper length across different islands.
- Customizations such as removing the default gray background, adding custom axis titles, and applying a custom color palette.
- Combining multiple plots into one comprehensive figure using the cowplot package.

_**Purpose**_: This file was created for a course assignment to demonstrate skills in data visualization and statistical analysis. It required creating complex plots to analyze and present relationships in the **palmerpenguins** dataset, highlighting proficiency in R programming, and effective data communication techniques.

## _**Name of file**_: _`Function Draft #2.Rmd`_

_**What it does**_: This file contains R code for three functions utilizing the **`AdvancedBasketballStats`** and **`NBAloveR`** packages. It demonstrates how to aggregate individual player statistics into team statistics, obtain comprehensive historical performance data for a specific NBA team, and retrieve detailed salary information for players on a specific NBA team. The file includes multiple sections, each showcasing a different function:

- **`team_stats`**: Aggregates individual player statistics into team statistics.
- **`getTeamHistory`**: Fetches historical performance data for a specified NBA team.
- **`getTeamSalary`**: Provides detailed salary information for players on a specified NBA team.

_**Purpose**_: Created for a course assignment to demonstrate the ability to work with specialized R packages for basketball data analysis. This file showcases practical applications of these functions for analyzing and visualizing basketball statistics, which can be useful for analysts, coaches, and fans.
