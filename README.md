# Welcome to my R portfolio

**Name of file**: _Dawood_week6.rmd_

**What it does**: This file contains R code structured to create several publication-quality visualizations using the ggplot2 and palmerpenguins packages. Specifically, it includes:

- A violin plot showing the relationship between penguin flipper length and sex.
- A faceted violin plot to display flipper length differences across species while distinguishing between sexes.
- A violin plot comparing flipper length across different islands.
- Customizations such as removing the default gray background, adding custom axis titles, and applying a custom color palette.
- Combining multiple plots into one comprehensive figure using the cowplot package.

**Purpose**: This file was created for a course assignment to demonstrate skills in data visualization and statistical analysis. It required creating complex plots to analyze and present relationships in the **palmerpenguins** dataset, highlighting proficiency in R programming, and effective data communication techniques.

**Name of file**: _Function Draft #2_
